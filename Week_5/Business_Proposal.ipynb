    "## The Battle of Neighbourhood- Introduction and Business Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction: A description of the problem and a discussion of the background\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to help people to know about the neighbourhood so that to select the neighbourhood having better facilities. It will help people to take smart decision on selecting the better neighbourhood out of numbers of other neighbourhood in North York, Canada.\n",
    "Now a day’s lot’s of people are migrating to various cities of Canada in search of jobs or business, The project is for those people who are looking for better neighbourhood in terms of accessibility, Schools, Market, Theatres, hospitals, opportunities etc.\n",
    "The aim of project is to analyse the features to do the comparative analysis of neighbourhoods. The attributes includes crime rates, housing prices, school’s according to rating, connectivity, weather conditions, hospitals, water resources, waste water treatment facilities. \n",
    "The project will be helpful for people to get aware about the locality before moving to a new city or else to decide the location which is more suitable for him/her.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Attributes: A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)\tCrime rate: The crime rate of locality is a good way to judge about the ease of life in the city, low crime rate indicates good locality and high crime rate indicates safety issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tHousing prices: Median of housing prices can be used to find out the price range of the houses in the neighbourhood for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tSchool’s: This attribute shows the average rating of School’s for the given city in terms of quality, fees and ratings, Highest rating indicates better Schools and educational facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)\tConnectivity: It indicates the connectivity of the locality, good connectivity indicates ease of travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)\tWeather condition: It shows the weather conditions of the cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)\tHospitals: It tell about the availability medical facilities \n",
    "\n",
    "7)\tWater resources: It is very important to have a good amount of water resources nearby the city for ease of living.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)\tWaste water treatment: Poor waste management implies poor life style and poor management. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem which we are trying to solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question we are trying to answer is “Can we suggest the better neighbourhood to the person who is about to migrate to North York, Canada by considering various essential facilities ?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach: \n",
    "\n",
    "The data gathered for this project belongs to unlabelled data i.e. without any target column, the approach is basically is to use  unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-Means clustering to compare the similarities of the two cities, K-means can be used to explore the neighbourhood and cluster the cities according to their similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries and API’s needed:\n",
    "Some of the libraries which will be used in this project are mentioned below: \n",
    "1)\tFoursquare API: Foursquare offers best results in terms of data gathering. It has a database of millions places and it’s API has the ability to perform location search, business search etc. Foursquares developers credentials are used for this project and due to the limited access to the number of calls we will limit the number of neighbourhood and radius to minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tPandas: It will be used to handle the data\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tMatplotlib: It will be used to plot the graphs and visualise the data\n",
    "\n",
    "4)\tScikit-learn: This machine learning library is used to import k-means clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)\tFolium: This library will be used to visualise the neighbourhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)\tGeocoder: It will be used to retrieve the location data.\n",
